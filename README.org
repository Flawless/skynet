* Config
the system is configured throught env vars (using juxt/aero lib), take a look on available settings in
resources/config.edn file.
For development purpuses it's easy to use direnv (and its emacs integration) so just put your tg bot and openai tokens
in .envrc file and allow them like so (in project root)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
echo "export OPENAI_TOKEN=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export TG_BOT_TOKEN=0000000000:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" > .envrc

direnv allow .
#+END_SRC
